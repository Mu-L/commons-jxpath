Apache Commons JXPath 1.4.0 Release Notes
-----------------------------------------

The Apache Commons JXPath team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Commons JXPath 1.4.0.

Introduction
------------

A Java-based implementation of XPath 1.0 that, in addition to XML processing, can inspect/modify Java object graphs (the library's explicit purpose) and even mixed Java/XML structures.

New features and bug fixes.
